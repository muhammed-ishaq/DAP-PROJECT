PREDICTING CUSTOMER RETENTION USING RFM AND LTV MODELS - A ANALYSIS ON AMAZON CUSTOMER DATA

ABSTRACT:

This project focuses on customer behavior analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and Lifetime Value (LTV) modeling. By segmenting customers based on their purchase patterns, we aim to identify high-value customers, improve retention strategies, and optimize marketing efforts. The analysis reveals insights into purchasing trends, customer loyalty, and revenue potential, providing actionable recommendations for strategic decision-making.

THE IMPORTANT FINDINGS & VISUALIZATIONS OF MY PROJECTS:

RFM(RECENCY,FREQUENCY,MONETORY) DISTRIBUTION:

INSIGHTS:
 
The data shows that most customers are moderately recent buyers, occasional purchasers, and have spent smaller amounts, with only a few being high-value or highly engaged 
customers. This highlights opportunities to engage occasional buyers and reward high-value customers.


LTV(LIFETIME VALUE) DISTRIBUTION:

INSIGHTS:

Most customers have a low lifetime value, concentrated near the left side of the graph.
A small number of customers have significantly higher LTV, extending to the right
This distribution is right-skewed, meaning that only a few customers contribute a large portion of total revenue.

INSIGHTS:

Customer 4934 has the highest LTV, contributing nearly 6 million in total sales.
Customer 46978 also has a significantly high LTV.
The other top customers have LTVs in a similar range, around 4 to 5 million.


REPEAT VS UNIQUE CUSTOMERS:

INSIGHTS:

This pie chart shows the proportion of Repeat Customers versus One-Time Buyers. Key points:
90.7% of customers are one-time buyers, meaning they made a single purchase.
Only 9.3% of customers are repeat buyers who made multiple purchases.


TOP 10 RATED BRAND FROM 2015 TO 2018:

INSIGHTS:

Savage and Plemo have the highest shares (10.3% each).
Fintie and Tiamat follow closely with 10.2% and 10.0%, respectively.
Apple, Bose, and Fujifilm also hold 10.0% to 9.9%.
Olympus, Gary Fong, and Canon share the lowest (9.8% each)


CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT:

The analysis shows that most customers are moderately recent buyers, make 1-2 purchases, and contribute low to moderate revenue. A small group of high-value customers significantly impacts revenue and should be prioritized. Thereâ€™s potential to boost engagement and retention among low-frequency and at-risk customers through targeted strategies.
